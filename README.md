## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **Cybersecurity Engineer** focused on practical security execution. I bridge the gap between offensive security (Red Team) and defensive operations (Blue Team/SOC). My work moves beyond theory to include **hands-on exploitation, network analysis, digital forensics, and remediation**.

* **Focus:** Securing systems end-to-end, from intentionally vulnerable labs to production-style cloud environments.
* **Methodology:** Hands-on, methodical, and outcome-driven.
* **Current State:** Building security-aware AI systems and strengthening Cloud Security postures (AWS & Azure).
