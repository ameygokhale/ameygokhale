# Amey Gokhale

Cybersecurity Engineer with hands-on experience across **security testing, cloud security, SOC operations, and digital forensics**.
My work focuses on **practical security execution**, structured analysis, and real-world remediation.

I design, assess, and secure systems end-to-end — from intentionally vulnerable lab environments to production-style cloud and security-aware AI systems.

---

## What I Do

I work across the security lifecycle, including:

* Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web, network, and cloud environments
* Analyzing network traffic, logs, and system artifacts for incident investigation
* Performing digital forensics and malware analysis
* Designing detection, monitoring, and defensive security controls
* Applying automation and AI selectively to improve security outcomes

My approach is **hands-on, methodical, and outcome-driven**.
